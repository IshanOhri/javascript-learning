// JS is dynamically typed which means we can change the data type of variable.
//JS is loosely typed which means we don't have to define data types like int, string while declaring variables.

var num = 16; // Number 
var name = "Ishan"; // String
var flag = false; // bollean

//alert(num);
document.write(num);
